# Who am I :smile:

**I am a huge HUGE movie fan** My favorite film is *Casablanca*, becuase it's just the greatest love story in the world. The three reasons why are becuase...
1.The actors are amazing
2. The sound is wonderful
3. Its beautiful..

I am a big country music fan. One of my favorite bands are [Lady Antebellum](https://www.ladyantebellum.com/). This band's song, *Compass* awlays makes me cry. My favorite line is as follows: 
>So let your heart sweetheart, be your compass when you're lost.
>And you should follow it wherever it may go.  

Everytime I hear that song, it just makes me smile.  Here is an image of her so you can see how beatufiful she is.

# What coding means to me.

I remember when I started to code, it was not good. My code was simple and just ugly. It looks like the one below. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
Thankfully, I have learned so much over the last two years at UNI. Mostly coming from doing it myself, and part from helping others.
